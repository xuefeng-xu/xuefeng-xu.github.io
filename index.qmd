### Biography

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Warwick, supervised by [Graham Cormode](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/) and collaborating with [Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/hakan_ferhatosmanoglu/). My research interests are privacy-preserving algorithms, particularly in the context of privacy-preserving machine learning. I received my M.E. from Beihang University and B.E. from Jilin University.
